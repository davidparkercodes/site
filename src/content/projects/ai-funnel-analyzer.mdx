An advanced analytics platform that uses artificial intelligence to analyze user behavior funnels, automatically identifying drop-off points and suggesting optimization strategies. The system processes millions of events in real-time to provide actionable insights for improving conversion rates.

## Key Features

- Real-time funnel analysis with AI-powered insights
- Automatic bottleneck detection and alerting
- Event-driven architecture for scalable processing
- Predictive analytics for conversion optimization
- Custom funnel builder with drag-and-drop interface

## Technical Architecture

Built with a microservice architecture using Python and Celery for distributed task processing. Redis provides high-performance caching and message queuing, while Azure Service Bus handles reliable message delivery between services. The system uses SQL databases for structured analytics data with optimized query performance.

## Impact

Enables data-driven decision making by automatically analyzing user journeys and providing actionable recommendations that have increased conversion rates by up to 35% across implemented platforms.
